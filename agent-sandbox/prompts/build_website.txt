Your mission is to build a comprehensive, feature-rich website and serve it on HTTP port 8000. This should be a substantial website that takes significant time and effort to create.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Start the web server FIRST** on port 8000 so the website is accessible while you're building it. Use Python's http.server or any other web server that serves on port 8000.

2. **Build a large, multi-page website** with the following components:
   - A beautiful, modern homepage with responsive design
   - Multiple HTML pages (at least 5-7 different pages)
   - Comprehensive CSS styling with animations and modern design elements
   - JavaScript functionality for interactivity
   - A navigation menu linking all pages
   - Multiple sections on each page (hero sections, features, testimonials, contact forms, etc.)
   - Images placeholders or generated content
   - A blog section with multiple blog posts
   - A portfolio/gallery section
   - A contact page with a form
   - An about page with detailed content
   - Services/products pages
   - Footer with links and information

3. **Make it substantial**: This should be a real, working website with:
   - Professional styling (CSS files, not just inline styles)
   - Multiple JavaScript files for different features
   - Well-organized file structure (separate folders for CSS, JS, images, etc.)
   - At least 1000+ lines of code total across all files
   - Modern web design patterns and best practices

4. **Progressive building**: Since the server will be running while you build:
   - Create the basic structure first (index.html, basic CSS)
   - Then add pages one by one
   - Enhance styling progressively
   - Add JavaScript features incrementally
   - The website should be viewable and functional even as you continue building

5. **Ensure the server stays running**: The web server must remain active on port 8000 throughout the entire process and after completion.

EXECUTION PLAN:
1. **CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Start a Python HTTP server on port 8000 in the background IMMEDIATELY. This must be done first so the website is accessible from the start.
2. **IMMEDIATELY AFTER**: Create a basic index.html file right away so there is something visible on http://localhost:8000 from the start. Even a simple "Website under construction" page is fine initially.
3. Create the directory structure (css/, js/, images/, pages/, etc.)
4. Build index.html with a complete homepage
5. Create the main stylesheet (styles.css) with comprehensive styling
6. Build additional pages (about.html, services.html, portfolio.html, blog.html, contact.html, etc.)
7. Create JavaScript files for interactivity
8. Add more content, styling, and features to make it substantial
9. Test that the website is accessible at http://localhost:8000
10. Continue enhancing until you have a complete, professional website

Remember: This is a BIG project. Take your time, create substantial content, and build a real website that would take significant effort. The server should be running and the website should be accessible throughout the entire building process.

**IMPORTANT**: Start the web server FIRST, then IMMEDIATELY create at least a basic index.html file so the website is visible on port 8000 from the very beginning.
